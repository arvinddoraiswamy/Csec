fio09 - unclear how this is a vulnerability. Not implementing right now.
fio14 - SEEK_END usage - non portability.
fio15 - easier to do this with OS permissions. Not using the function that is written there.
fio34 - skip this for now.
fio41 - skip this for now.
fio45 - very similar to fio1 and fio3.
