Csec
====

A series of POCs based on the C secure coding page on the Cert website. The Cert secure coding page has a number of rules that encourage Secure coding in C. Since I am pretty poor at C as things stand, I figured a good way to get better would be to go through all these rules over time, download and compile the examples online - and understand the issues that C is affected by.

The first step will be to simply read through the issue, download and compile code. Once the issue is understood, the next step is to develop simple working POC exploits for each of these and document them clearly.

Anyone, in the end, should be able to read a page there, run the vulnerable code and then run the simple non-malicious exploit against the vulnerable code to understand how things work.

Here is the base URL that all my work is based on - https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standard

There isn't any deadline for this work - it is a work in progress and I will keep reading and uploading as and when I get time :)
