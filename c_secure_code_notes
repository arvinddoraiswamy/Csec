Whetstone goal:
Objective

To be able to review and write secure code in C

Key Results
    Read a book on Secure Code Review in C.
    Convert this into a checklist/test plan/template.
    Write an insecure/secure application in C similar to what I did with Java.
    Use the exploits that I developed in my reverse engineering goal as payloads here.

Reviewer Comments:
Good goal. Do you have much of a C background currently? One thing I've always learned a lot from is looking at bugs (not necessarily security) in open source projects, and contributing fixes if possible.
---------

Detailed notes:
- Need to identify a book (Kernighan/Ritchie of course, Robert Seacord is another one). I'd prefer to buy Kindle versions of both so I can read them at any time.
- Use CERT secure coding guide online to try and develop a testing checklist for as many vulnerabilities as possible. [https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/CERT+C+Coding+Standard]
- Try and start off a document like my Java document and add to it as life goes on :)
- Look at Wireshark code base and try and do a code review for parts of it
